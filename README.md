# learn-ML
## About this Repository
*Before moving to any learning , you must know what you will take from here and how you will be mananging your time.*
Here are some bullet points
 1) I will be suggesting time period(Do not worry if things take more time that you decided to gave) to complete each topic but it totally depends on you that what suits you best. After completing these following steps you will be an intermediate ML developer starting from scratch. I am assuming that you do not know any programming language and this repository will be based on one programing language "the programming language called *Python*". 
 2) If you want to become an advance ML developer then there are many ways but what I suggest is *making projects* and *getting feedbacks* from one who is better than you , do not hesitate to ask me also or anyone. Now moving forward another way I will suggest is *contributing to open source* , open source is also one of the best way to get *feedback on your project* , how? Just *post your projects your social media* after that just see the magic but you have to persist. There is no limits to sky , may be in future you will be giving your own researches.

## 3)ROADMAP , finally!
#### Starting with the most basic , you must know a programming language and it is PYTHON for sure. I am providing resources for learning this language , remember you have to go with basic syntax not like expert in DSA    
*Preferred priorities 0>1>2*[choose only one] and do not hesitate to choose your own one      
*TimePeriod* : 2 weeks

After 2 weeks   
## Repo was waiting for you...   
Now You had just came a good way , I mean you do not know that what you have achieved. Please applause for yourself.   

### let's learn some maths for ML(it is totally optional)
There are four parts to learn about  
1)Multivariable Calculus :    
i) Khan Academy(0): https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus
ii) MIT OpenCourseWare(1) : https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/    
2)Differential Equation : https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations
3)Linear Algebra :   
i) Khan Academy(0) : https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus
ii) MIT OpenCourseWare(1) : https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/
4)Statistics and Probability :    
i) Khan Academy(0) : https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability    
ii)MIT OpenCourseWare(1) : https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/

### Now lets head to practice
*The preferred way is making a project along with learning some basic libaries such as Pandas , Numpy and Matplotlib*   
For python project   
*TimePeriod* : 3 weeks

### Along with practice Learn Basic Python lib used in ML : all had taught well!   
1)CWH : https://youtu.be/Rbh1rieb3zc [Numpy] , https://youtu.be/RhEjmHeDNoA [Pandas] , Matplotlib not taught    
2)FreecodeCamp : https://youtu.be/QUT1VHiLmmI [Numpy] , Not seprated video available for PANDAS , https://youtu.be/3Xc3CA655Y4 [MatplotLib]    
3)Keith Galli : https://youtu.be/vmEHCJofslg [Pandas]

##### After 3 Weeks  , you deserves a applause if you are here...    
### Now let's head to next which will be actual machine learning: It will take your 4 weeks    
*You have to do two things at a time no. It is easy!*
first is ML :    
1) Andrew Ng(1) : https://in.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
2) CampusX(for Hinglish)(1) : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH   
3) FreeCodeCamp(0) : https://youtu.be/NWONeJKn6kc   

* Along with it you should learn about scikit-learn *
1) Docs : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html
2) ProgrammingKnowledge : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7ha9SewcZlsTQVwL7n7oq
3) FreeCodeCamp : https://youtu.be/0B5eIE_1vpU

Congrats you have done with ML learning phase now only thing you need to is 
### Practice : Just try doing one project per week for 5 weeks 
1) Siddhardhan : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfFghEzKVmjvuSA67LszN1dZ-Dd_pkus6
2) CampusX : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvY5eP91BGPa0vXUYmIdtfPQ    

Very Congrats , yes , you are completed now , start doing contributing to Open source!   
Here are some additional resources :   
1) Git : https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp
2) Github : https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world    

After that do not watch many tutorials , just go and contribute your first issue will take your around 1 month.
Happy Journey :)
