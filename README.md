# learn-ML
## About this Repository
*Before moving to any learning , you must know what you will take from here and how you will be mananging your time.*
Here are some bullet points
 1) I will be suggesting time period to complete each topic but it totally depends on you that what suits you best. After cpmplleting these following steps you will be an intermediate ML developer starting from scratch. I am assuming that you do not know programming language and this repository will be based on one and the programming language called *Python*. 
 2) If you want to become an advance ML developer then there are many ways but what I suggest is *making projects* and *getting feedbacks* from one who is better than you , do not hesitate to ask me also or anyone. Now moving forward another way I will suggest is *contributing to open source* , open source is also one of the best way to get *feedback on your project* , how? Just *post your projects your social media* after that just see the magic but you have to persist. There is no limits to sky , may be in future you will be giving your own researches.

## 3)ROADMAP , finally!
### Starting with the most basic , you must know a programming language and it is PYTHON for sure. I am providing resources for learning this language , remember you have to go with basic syntax not like expert in DSA    
*Preferred priorities 0>1>2*[choose only one]

After 2 weeks   
### Now lets head to practice
*The preferred way is making a project along with learning some basic libaries such as Pandas , Numpy and Matplotlib*   
For python project
